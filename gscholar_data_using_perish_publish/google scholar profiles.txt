SSL meeting
compare semi-supervised setup with with the chen paper
what is base model (unlabelled setup), and its performance



As per my knowledge, the paper presents a novel research work. 
It performs a significant improvement over the previous work.
It's a good fit for the AMCIS and can be approved for oral presentation. 



In summary, this paper introduces HNSW++, an effort to address several limitations to improve the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. The key limitations of standard HNSW are susceptibility to local optima, poor inter-cluster connectivity, and inefficient layer-by-layer traversal which are addressed in this paper. 

Strengths
- authors propose three key innovations:  A dual-branch graph structure, Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID)-based node insertion and LID-guided skip-layer bridges.

- perform comprehensive experiments on 12 datasets across various domains (CV, NLP, Recommendation Systems) and compare HNSW++ performance against multiple baselines. 

- authors perform rigorous time complexity analysis and ablation studies which proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework


Weaknesses
-  Algorithms 2 - 5 needs proper formatting, currently which looks dense and compact

- More literature study and the discussion of these work can make the literature study more comprehensive

- More explanation on the criteria for activating skip connections i.e. choice of LID threshold and distance threshold could be more clearly explained and justified

- More explanation on concepts like jump conditions and bridge selection would be better to understand the concepts clearly for the reader

- Correcting some spelling error like "verrsion" need to be done

- Clearer & more detailed explanation of the experimental results would be better for reader


Overall, the paper can be accepted if the minor weaknesses are addressed.

Chatgpt Prompt:
provide me some research papers related to classification of research profile into malicious and benign classes based on citation manipulation, citation hike, citation fraud

Response:
​Detecting and classifying research profiles based on citation manipulation is a critical area of study aimed at preserving the integrity of academic metrics. Below is a selection of research papers that delve into various aspects of citation manipulation, including detection methods and the classification of research profiles into malicious and benign categories:​

"Citation manipulation through citation mills and pre-print servers"

Authors: [Not specified]​

Published: February 2025​

Summary: This study examines a dataset of approximately 1.6 million Google Scholar profiles to identify instances of citation fraud. It highlights how less restrictive indexing protocols, particularly those involving unmoderated sources like personal websites and specific pre-print servers, facilitate unique citation manipulation practices not observed in other bibliometric databases. ​

"Spotting Suspicious Academic Citations Using Self-Learning Graph Transformers"

Authors: [Not specified]​

Published: December 2022​
BioRxiv

arXiv
+6

Summary: This research introduces a novel method to detect potential citation manipulation in academic papers by employing perturbations of a deep embedding model, specifically utilizing Graph Masked Autoencoders. The approach integrates textual information with graph connectivity evidence to model citation distributions more effectively. ​

ResearchGate
+1

Published: July 2021​

Summary: This paper focuses on identifying citation cartels—groups of journals that excessively cite each other's publications. The authors propose a method to detect such anomalous citation groups by analyzing within-group citation behaviors, thereby uncovering potential manipulative practices. ​

"Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection"

Authors: Jiaying Liu, Feng Xia, Xu Feng, Jing Ren, Huan Liu​
arXiv

Published: February 2022​
arXiv

Summary: This study presents GLAD (Graph Learning for Anomaly Detection), a deep graph learning model designed to identify anomalies in citation networks. By incorporating both node and link attributes through graph neural networks, GLAD uncovers hidden relationships between papers and detects citation anomalies indicative of manipulation. ​

Summary: This paper reports on a method of citation manipulation involving 'sneaked' references—references registered in metadata but absent from the actual articles. The authors document how this practice artificially inflates citation counts and discuss its implications for bibliometric platforms and research evaluation. ​
